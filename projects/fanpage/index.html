            <h3>MY STORY</h3>
            <p>Hello. My name is Haris Jaganjac. I go by the name Pronto Valid, and Ive been making music since I was 11 years old. I make Hip-Hop music with elements of Pop, Punk, and EDM on the production side. I go by the belief that my music speaks for itself and I don't have to tell you too much of my story through a message when I'd rather have you listen to it. However, there are certain elements of my story, and myself as a person, that are essential for you to know about to truly understand me as an artist. I am a first-generation Bosnian-American. My parents came to Chicago in the late 90s after escaping the war and ethnic cleansing that was happening in Bosnia at the time. Although I didnt physically have to go through my parents struggle, I vividly recall them talking about many of the horror stories that they went through and how they survived - and I grew up with that. I dont speak about it much in the media or in my music, since the story is not mine to tell, but their stories along with other stories from family members shaped my mindset from an early age. It was hard for me to trust others and I would often avoid topics dealing with my culture/heritage altogether in order to slip past any awkward or emotionally provocative conversations. This distrust in people metastasized into self-deprecating behaviors and habits that led me down a dark path. In my music, I speak about battling through addiction and heartbreak and how I've had to overcome both multiple times in order to pursue a better version of myself. Like others, I have battled through adversity in my youth and was blackballed by peers as early as grade school, only to end up impressing some of the same people who once doubted me. Ive made friends out of adversaries. Ive made adversaries out of friends. All of this, along with other life events, shaped me into the person and artist I am today. I hope you enjoy listening to my music as much as I enjoy making it, and I hope you connect to my story as if it were your own. </p>

            <h3>BIO</h3>
            <p>Pronto Valid is a multi talented genre-bending musician from Chicago, IL. His palette includes a diverse mix of different cultures and genres of music. His unique sound includes mixes of vibrant synth-based and natural instruments, paired with high-intensity basslines and descriptive lyricism.

                Influenced by bands and artists like Linkin Park, Lupe Fiasco, Juice WRLD, Drake, Metallica, and Kendrick Lamar, Hip-hop and Rock music caught his attention the most growing up. Like many, his first experiences with playing music were in school. He was taught to play the trumpet, drums, piano, and more.
                
                Although he was never classically trained, his urge for excellence and creativity allowed him to teach himself to play popular children's songs on these instruments - which he would share by performing to professors and classmates. From these experiences, a new world of expression was shown to him.
                
                At the age of eleven, he began writing his first song lyrics and signed up for talent shows to hone in on his skills as a live performer. At fifteen he began recording and engineering his own music, where he discovered the beauty of being fully in control of his own craft - a practice which he continues to this day, and which inspired him to also become a producer.
                
                Fast forward to the age of twenty-three and he has released multiple albums and singles as an independent artist and continues to grow as he is influenced by the world around him.
